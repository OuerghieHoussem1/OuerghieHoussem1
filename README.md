Hey there! 👋 Recent CS grad here, diving headfirst into the tech world like a kid in a candy store. I've got 4 years of freelance wizardry under my belt, conjuring up web, desktop, and mobile magic.

You know, I've got this quirky passion for IoT – it's like making everyday stuff do the cha-cha with technology. Picture this: I built a system that lets me boss around my room gadgets from anywhere. Who needs a remote control when you've got coding skills, right? 😄

I speak the language of C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python. I've even dabbled in some modeling, design, and database sorcery. And when I'm not summoning code, I'm a Photoshop guru and video editing aficionado. Lights, camera, action!

Workwise, I've been the full-stack maestro for various gigs, from managing events to crafting web games. Oh, and I'm currently tinkering with ink screens and web platforms that talk to e-paper displays. It's like tech art in motion!

Now, as for my formal education, I've got a bachelor's degree in experimental sciences and a computer science degree that covers everything from web development to IoT networks. I'm also on the quest for an IOT Engineer title – ain't no stopping this tech train!

When I'm not geeking out, I'm out there running, volunteering, hiking, camping, cycling, or just soaking in some good old movies and music. Oh, and did I mention I've got a knack for photography? 📸

Languages? Well, I'm fluent in Arabic and French, rock English like a pro, and dabble in a bit of German for good measure.

So there you have it – that's me in a nutshell. Ready to team up and make some tech magic happen? Let's do this! ✨🚀
